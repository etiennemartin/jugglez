Jugglez is an open source and free game that I wrote during my spare time in the efforts to learn Swift. The game was an idea I had bouncing around my head and with the introduction of Swift it was a perfect time to learn SpriteKit along with Swift. It wasn't until I showed the game to my friends that I decided to make this game available to the public. So I hope you enjoy the game!

# Gameplay

The game has 4 game modes (for the time being). 

## Game Modes

The Easy mode starts off with the biggest ball size and lowest gravity values. As you go up in difficulty the balls get smaller and the starting gravity is higher. Juggle five times and an extra balls is introduced. Drop a ball and the gravity is increased! The game ends when all the balls have been dropped.

The export mode isn't like the others. When playing in expert mode the ball size is reduced, and you aren't allowed to drop a single ball. One ball drop and it's game over!

## Scoring

The scoring is as simple as it gets. One juggle (ball tap) is equal to one point. Points add up to make your final score.

# App Store

A link to the App Store will be provided once the game is ready.

# Future features

Here's a few future features I may or may not get around to do. If you want to contribute to the game feel free! All new features, bug fixes, will be rolled into the game and credit will be given (within the game).

* Music during gameplay
* Randomized silly faces on the balls
* Funky backgrounds
